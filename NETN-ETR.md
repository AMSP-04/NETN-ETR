The NETN-ETR FOM module provides a standard interface for sending tasks to simulated entities represented in a federated distributed simulation.

The NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Entity Tasking and Reports (ETR) Module defines interactions that can be interpreted and executed by simulators that model the behaviour of a tasked entity. The module also defines reports sent by simulated entities.

The module defines the pattern for tasking simulated entities and provides a core set of tasks. Other NETN modules define additional tasks. Provided task definitions reflects the capabilities commonly found in COTS Computer Generated Forces (CGF) applications but are independent of a specific CGF, agent framework, or agent modelling paradigm. 
            
A tasked entity can be either a physical entity (e.g. platform or lifeform) or an aggregate entity. The task definition itself does not specify how a simulation models the execution of the task.

## Overview 
The NETN-ETR module extends the RPR-FOM object class `BaseEntity` with optional attributes related to tasking. 
These include a list of what tasks are supported, previous, planned, current, and progress of ongoing tasks. 
 
 
Tasking and reporting use the following base interaction classes: 
 
* `Task` is a subclass of the NETN-SMC `SMC_EntityControl` class for sending control actions to a federate modelling a referenced entity. The `Task` interaction class is the base class for all tasks defined in NETN-ETR and other modules. 
* `ETR_Report` is a base class for reports generated by entities. 
 
### Tasks 
 
Entity tasking uses the standard `SMC_EntityControl` Request-Response pattern. 
 
* A TaskingFederate sends a `Taks` interaction with task parameters to an EntityFederate. 
* If the task is accepted, the receiving EntityFederate sends a `SMC_Respose` indicating success. 
* During the execution of the task, the EntityFederate sends `ETR_TaskStatus` to notify of any change in the task execution status. 
 
The `ETR_TaskStatus` interaction provides the following notifications regarding the task: 
 
* Accepted: the task is received and scheduled for execution 
* Refused: the task is not accepted for execution 
* Waiting: the task is waiting for execution 
* Executing: the task is running 
* Completed: the task has been executed successfully 
* Cancelled: the task execution has been explicitly terminated 
* Error: the task execution has been terminated due to a modelling error 
 
 
A task can be executed concurrently with other tasks or sequentially. The task parameters indicate the expected mode of task execution. Tasks are scheduled based on their start time and task execution mode. 
 
The execution of a task can start if: 
 
* For a non-concurrent task 
* No other non-concurrent task is executing 
* The task has the earliest `StartTime` parameter of all planned non-concurrent tasks 
* The task parameter `StartTime` is less than or equal to the current `ScenarioTime`. 
* For a concurrent task 
* The task parameter `StartTime` is less than or equal to the current `ScenarioTime`. 
 
Scheduled tasks are published using the `PlannedTasks` attribute of the simulated entity. 
 
Currently executing tasks and their execution progress are published using the simulated entity's `CurrentTasks` and `TaskProgress` attributes. 
 
Completed tasks are published using the `PreviousTasks` attribute of the simulated entity. 
 
Use the NETN-SMC `BaseEntity` attribute `SupportedActions` to indicate which tasks are supported. Normally, a TaskingFederate check supported tasks before sending a `Task`.


## Object Classes

Note that inherited and dependency attributes are not included in the description of object classes.

```

### BaseEntity

A base class of aggregate and discrete scenario domain participants. The BaseEntity class is characterized by being located at a particular location in space and independently movable, if capable of movement at all. It specifically excludes elements normally considered to be a component of another element. The BaseEntity class is intended to be a container for common attributes for entities of this type. Since it lacks sufficient class specific attributes that are required for simulation purposes, federates cannot publish objects of this class. Certain simulation management federates, e.g. viewers, may subscribe to this class. Simulation federates will normally subscribe to one of the subclasses, to gain the extra information required to properly simulate the entity.

|CurrentTasks|ArrayOfTaskDefinitions|Optional. An array of currently executing tasks.|
|TaskProgress|ArrayOfTaskProgress|Optional. An array of progress for current tasks.|
|PlannedTasks|ArrayOfTaskDefinitions|Optional. An array of all planned tasks.|
|PreviousTasks|ArrayOfTaskDefinitions|Optional. An array of completed or cancelled tasks.|
